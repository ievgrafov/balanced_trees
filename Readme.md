### Purpose

I wrote those for myself to rewind how to actually write some academic algorythmic code myself.
The repo contains 2 different balanced trees implementation, BTreee and Treap.
Later on I used them to solve some challenges on leetcode and therefore they were enchanced
with methods like upper/lower boundary.

For more details on the idea of the trees you might want to read something like https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~avrim/451f11/lectures/lect0927.pdf (I personally found it useful).
